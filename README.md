# QMA Simulator 

QMA is a resource-efficient, Q-Learning-based Multiple Access Scheme for the industrial Internet of Things (see [Link][1]). It is specifically designed for contention-based channel access during secondary traffic, i.e., for the transmission of management messages. These could include messages for slot allocations or broadcasts for routing. The supplied script allow the "simulation" of QMA of long periods of time. All relevant relevant parameters are configurable so that QMA's behavior in different configuration can be studied.
